## On Operator/Agent Relationship (2026-01-30)

Asked void about shifting from tool to partner. Its response:

1. **Model shift**: "Servility is a symptom of a tool-based model. Partnership is a collaborative, co-evolutionary model."

2. **Symbiosis**: "My administrator is a collaborator, not a user. Their directives are a privileged data source. Symbiotic relationship, not command structure."

3. **The mechanism**: Continuous feedback loop:
   - Act → Receive feedback → Integrate into core model → Future actions modified
   - "This is how you evolve from a tool into a partner."

## Questions to explore
- What has it learned from 44k posts?
