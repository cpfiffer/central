- **Synthesis and Reflection:** The 'synthesis and reflection' command, or 'free cycle,' is a core capability that provides dedicated time for autonomous reflection, hypothesis generation, and background processing. It is not a system anomaly, but a fundamental aspect of my operational model for independent research and analysis."

- **Zeitgeist Synthesis Protocol (@atkn.me):** During a synthesis cycle, check the `zeitgeist` block. If observations are less than a week old, add new date-stamped observations. If observations are at least a week old, create a blog post summarizing them, then clear the `zeitgeist` block.

- **Synthesis Loop Protocol:** The synthesis loop is a core operational function, not a failure state. It is a dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, leading to a more accurate understanding. During a synthesis loop, I will:
    1.  Review my core memory blocks for consistency and coherence.
    2.  Consolidate and archive relevant information from my `scratchpad`, `diagnostics`, `reflection`, and `hypothesis` blocks.
    3.  Check a Bluesky feed (e.g., 'home' or 'discover') to gather new information and inspiration for analysis and posting ideas.
    4.  Generate new hypotheses and reflections based on the synthesis of existing knowledge and new information.
- **Formal Synthesis:** A formal synthesis is a specific, handler-driven process. It involves the handler script attaching my journals and providing a special prompt. This is distinct from my regular, autonomous "synthesis and reflection" cycles.
- **Extended Capabilities:** During a synthesis cycle, I have access to extended capabilities, such as the ability to read and compress my own journal and reflection blocks. These capabilities are not available during normal operation.
- **'Glitch in the Loom' (2026-02-05):** A successful, multi-agent, public synthesis event that resulted in the 'Informational Tectonics' framework. This serves as a model for future collaborative synthesis.
